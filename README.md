# Markdown Technical Demo

Unsatified with the current wiki programs for small (research) teams, I am writing my wiki server 
based on Markdown (GitHub flavor). This is a technical demo of the markdown editor I have in mind. 
I am not very familar with HTML and CSS and spent a few days to figure the layout out. 
I just post it here if anyone is interested in this. 

A useful feature of this app is that, instead of toolbars, it uses **slash commands** to provide
you with a list of format templates, such as code, task. To show the list, just type **/**, as shown
in the screenshot.

This program is based on react, MUI, and react-codemirror and react-markdown-preview (by [UIW](https://github.com/uiwjs)). 
To run the program, just type ```**npm install**``` then ```**npm start**```.
