# Markdown Technical Demo

**Try a demo here: https://syssecfsu.github.io/markdown_demo/**

Unsatified with the current wiki programs for small (research) teams, I am writing my wiki server 
based on Markdown (GitHub flavor). This is a technical demo of the markdown editor I have in mind. 

A useful feature of this app is that, instead of toolbars, it uses **slash commands** to provide
you with a list of format templates, such as code, task. To show the list, just type **/**, as shown
in the screenshot.

This program is based on react, MUI, and react-codemirror and react-markdown-preview (by [UIW](https://github.com/uiwjs)). 
To run the program, make sure you have a recent version of npm installed, and just type **```npm install```** followed by
**```npm start```** under the main directory of the project.
