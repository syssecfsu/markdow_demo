# Markdown Technical Demo

Unsatified with the current wiki programs for small (research) teams, I am writing my wiki server 
based on Markdown (GitHub flavor). This is a technical demo of the markdown editor I have in mind. 
I am not very familar with HTML and CSS and spent a few days to figure the layout out. 
I just post it here if anyone is interested in this. 

A useful feature of this app is that, instead of toolbars, it uses **slash commands** to provide
you with a list of format templates, such as code, task. To show the list, just type **/**, as shown
in the screenshot.

This program is based on react, MUI, and react-codemirror and react-markdown-preview (by [UIW](https://github.com/uiwjs)). 
To run the program, see the instructions below. 


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
